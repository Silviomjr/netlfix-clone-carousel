# About

<p>This project is a practice session from <a href="https://digitalinnovation.one/">DIO</a> bootcamp. 
It's an exemple on how to work with HTML and CSS. Also, we used a JQuery plugin (<a href="https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/">Owl Carousel 2</a>) to apply the carousel effect on a set of images. </br> The instructor is: Felipe Aguiar (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-aguiar-047/">LinkedIn</a>).</p>
